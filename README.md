# Best Blog Ever: A Handlebars.js exercise

## Setup

These commands are a helpful quick start. You may choose to ignore them completely and create your own directory structure. If you choose to use this recommendation, just copy the commands below and paste. It doesn't matter what directory you are currently in.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/workspace/exercises/rich-browser/hbs-blog && cd $_
```

## Requirements

In this exercise you will use the technology you've learned to this point ( Browserify, SASS, Grunt) to
create a blog page with three short articles (You can use placeholder text for the articles).

Handlebars will be used to create your view -- a template and a JavaScript object bound together and rendered as HTML

> Make sure you have a `package.json` file in your `lib` folder, either by running `npm init` in that folder or repurposing a `package.json` from a previous project that used browserify and SASS. Add the necessary packages with
`npm install handlebars hbsfy --save`.

1. Create a blog page with three short articles.
1. Store each article's title, author, copy/content, and published date in an object in a json file.
1. The blog page should be a handlebars template that will be bound to the json data.

Use the following `Gruntfile.js` configuration in order to precompile your template(s). Be sure to match/update this info to match your project's file structure.

```
module.exports = function(grunt) {

  grunt.initConfig({
    // Change the b-fy task to add a transform task
    browserify: {
      js: {
          src: ['../js/quiz.js'],
          dest: '../dist/app.js'
      },
      options: {
          transform: ['hbsfy'],
          browserifyOptions: {
          paths: [
            "./node_modules"
            ]
          }
      }
    },
    jshint: {
      options: {
        predef: [ "document", "console", "$" ],
        esnext: true,
        globalstrict: true,
        globals: {},
        browserify: true
      },
      files: ['../js/**/*.js']
    },
    sass: {
      dist: {
        files: {
          '../css/main.css': '../sass/main.scss'
        }
      }
    },
    watch: {
      javascripts: {
        files: ['../js/**/*.js'],
        tasks: ['jshint', 'browserify']
      },
      sass: {
        files: ['../sass/**/*.scss'],
        tasks: ['sass']
      },
      hbs: {
        files: ['../templates/**/*.hbs'],
        tasks: ['browserify']
      }
    }
  });

  require('matchdep').filterDev('grunt-*').forEach(grunt.loadNpmTasks);

  grunt.registerTask('default', ['jshint', 'sass', 'browserify', 'watch']);
};
```

#### Stretch goal #1
Create a partial to display a navbar and a footer for your site. Include them in your blog page template.

#### Stretch goal #2
1. Add a helper function that allows your template to add today's date to each article instead of the date from the json file.
1. Add a "more posts" button to your page that reuses the template, but binds it to a second set of articles data.
